Everything learned from the 8 bit processor all in one place

This uses Logisim, downlad logisim and try it out!

In it's current development state its sort of all over the place at the moment. To view the current working version use the circuits and files that have Bus somewhere in the name.
 Any instruction that has a ~ next to it is implemented along with the amount of clock cycles it takes to execute.
 After you compile the compiler, the command will be (whatever the executable is called) (input file) (output file)
 Then load the image into RAM and make sure the instruction pointer is 0 then away you go.
